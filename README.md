üöÄ About The Project

"ESSENCE" is a project that demonstrates the use of the Django web framework to build a robust and scalable website. The site is designed to be the online presence for a fashion company, complete with a visually appealing homepage, static content pages, and a backend system to handle user interactions.

The key feature is a "Contact Us" form that captures user data (name, email, query) and saves it to a backend SQLite database, providing a confirmation message to the user upon successful submission using Django's messaging framework.
